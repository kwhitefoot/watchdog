#!/bin/bash

#====================================

# Purpose:

# I have a Python script that uploads to flickr.  On my netbook it
# fails to resume when the machine comes out of suspend.  Experiments
# show that sleep does not suffer from this problem so a watxhdog can
# be created.

# The Python script is inherently restartable so it is safe to kill it
# and restart.

#--------------------------------------------

# Method:
# start the process
# Forever:
#   s = mtime of a file or zero if the file does not exist.
#   sleep
#   f = mtime of same file or zero if the file still does not exist.
#   If s == f:
#      kill the process.
#      sleep 1
#      start the process
#   endif
# loop

# The file used to detect activity can be a file that the process
# touches as part of its normal operations or the process can be
# written deliberately to touch a file at intervals for just this
# purpose.

# The watchdog takes arguments specifying:
# - the path to the process to be started, 
# - path to the activity file,
# - the sleep time in whole minutes

# where the command line can be anything but remember that ~ will not
# be expanded if you quote it and that you will probably need to quote
# it unless it is a bare command with no arguments; use ${HOME}
# instead.  The same applies to the path to the activity file.

#--------------------------------------------

# Prerequisites

#set -x
#set -e

{
    echo "watchdog: $1"

# Kill subprocess on exit.

watchdog, version 1.0
Usage: watchdog command activity interval
Where:
  command is a command line to be executed.  Use quotes if it includes spaces
  activity is a file to be monitored
  interval is the number of minutes between checks.

This command executes the specified command and then loops checking to
see if a file changes.  If the file does not change within the
specified interval we kill the process and restart it and continue
checking.

If the command exits normally it will still be restarted as long as the activity file mtime does not change within the interval.
